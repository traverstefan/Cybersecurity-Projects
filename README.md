# Cybersecurity-Projects
This repository includes projects from the Live Project portion of The Tech Academy's Cybersecurity Boot Camp.  This includes both Offensive and Defensive Incident Reports involving the use of BurpSuite and knowledge of Penetration Testing techniques on OWASP's Juice Shop website for the Offensive side.  For the Defensive side, this included analyzing Packet Captures (PCAP) using WireShark, and reporting my findings on any malware that was identified.
